"""
This example is aim to find out how to use manager utility of picocell SDK.
Manager is a utility to manage the complicated processes have multiple steps,
specific execution order, need of response binded decision, etc.

In this example we will use manager to perform HTTP POST request to a server.
We will explain how to create a method by using manager step by step.

Example Configuration
---------------------
Create a config.json file in the root directory of the picocell device.
config.json file must include the following parameters for this example:

config.json
{
    "https":{
        "server":"[HTTP_SERVER]",
        "username":"[YOUR_HTTP_USERNAME]",
        "password":"[YOUR_HTTP_PASSWORD]"
    },
}

    # Creating step 5.
    # In this step we will read the response of server.
    # We will use the "read_response" step to check the response status.
