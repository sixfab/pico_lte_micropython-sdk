"""
Example code to find out ultra low power concept of the
picocell SDK and how to use it. This example imitates the
real jobs with a neopixel indicator function. Please change
the job() function with yours.

The SDK and the picocell hardware have same pre-configured
settings. Min control period is the most important preset in
this case. Min control period is 5 mins. This means, SDK checks
the wakeup reason every 5 mins. You can adjust the sleep period
with power of 5 mins.
